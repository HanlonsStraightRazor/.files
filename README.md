# My Vim Configuration
---
Vim has some decent default settings, but I added some extra stuff to boost productivity.

## Setup and Maintainence
---
Clone this repo in your home directory and run the setup.sh script from within the repo to get started. I also included an update.sh script that you should run every so often to stay up to date with my latest configuration and my plugins.

## New Bindings
---
I added several bindings that make accessing common functionality much easier such as toggling the spell checker, removing trailing whitespace, and launching Netrw. However, the binding I use the most is `kj`, which puts you back in normal mode and is a decent bit faster than reaching for the escape key. If you actually want to type the string "kj", then just wait a second after typing "k" before typing "j".

## Plugins
---
The plugins I'm currently running are:
- Vundle
- Lightline
- tComment
- Supertab
- ZoomWin
- surround.vim
- tagbar
