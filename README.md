# My Vim Configuration
---
Vim has some decent default settings, but I added some extra stuff to boost productivity.

## Setup and Maintenance
---
Clone this repo in your home directory and run the update.sh script from within the repo to get started. This script also updates the repo, so it should be run periodically to stay up to date.

## New Bindings
---
I added several bindings that make accessing common functionality much easier such as toggling the spell checker, removing trailing whitespace, and launching Netrw. However, the binding I use the most is `kj`, which puts you back in normal mode and is a decent bit faster than reaching for the escape key. If you actually want to type the string "kj", then just wait a second after typing "k" before typing "j".

## Plugins
---
The plugins I'm currently running are:
- Vundle
- Lightline
- tComment
- Supertab
- ZoomWin
- surround.vim
- tagbar
